Instructions 
This tutorial is about files.

Question 1
Write a Python program to analyse student marks read in from a file and determine which students need to see a student advisor. The students who (hypothetically!) need to see a student advisor are those with marks less than one standard deviation below the mean.

The marks file is composed of lines of text, where each line contains a student number and mark separated by a comma.

Remember that the formula for standard deviation is:

standard dev = sqrt (((X1 -µ)2+(X2 -µ)2 +(X3 -µ)2 +…+(XN -1 -µ)2) / N)

where µ is the mean or average and each Xi is a mark.

Before the list of student names, print out the average and standard deviation with 2 decimal points of precision.

Sample File (test1.txt)

Alan,35
Siobhan,23
Mmberengeni,38

Sample I/O

Enter the marks filename:
test1.txt
The average is: 32.00
The std deviation is: 6.48

Question 2
Write a program to reformat a text file so that all lines are at most a given length. Do not break up words. Write the formatted text to a new text file.

Treat each set of consecutive non-empty lines as a paragraph - join such lines together with a single space if necessary.

Sample File (input.txt):

Your program should store a single row of the triangle and calculate each subsequent row by adding a value to the values 
immediately above it and to its left.  The values on each line must be space-separated.

Sample File (output.txt):

Your program should store a single row
of the triangle and calculate each
subsequent row by adding a value to the
values immediately above it and to its
left.  The values on each line must be
space-separated.

Sample console I/O:

Enter the input filename:
input.txt
Enter the output filename:
output.txt
Enter the line width:
40
Save your program as question2 .py. Submit all source files only.

Question 3
Write a program to check if a complete Sudoku grid is valid or not.

A Sudoku grid is a 9x9 grid of integers, with each cell containing an integer value from 1-9. The input to your program is a set of nine lines, each containing 9 single digit integers with no intervening spaces. Your program must store these integers internally in a 2-dimensional array.

In a correct Sudoku solution, the following conditions hold:

•no 2 cells in the same row have the same value
•no 2 cells in the same column have the same value
•no 2 cells in the same 3x3 sub-grid have the same value - this is tested for the 9 non-overlapping sub-grids that a 9x9 grid can be divided into
