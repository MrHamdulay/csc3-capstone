Instructions
This tutorial is about functions and strings.

Question 1

Write a Python module that contains the following 3 functions to create hollow boxes of stars.

print_square (), that prints a 5x5 box on the screen
print_rectangle (width, height), that prints a box on the screen with given width and height
get_rectangle (width, height) that returns a string containing a box with given width and height
A python module is a file containing Python code just like a regular program. Typically such a module will contain only functions. To use the module in another program, we first issue the import statement, then refer to each function by prefixing it with the module name.

Save your module as boxes.py. The main program has been supplied as question1.py - use this to test your program and do not change this file.

Question 2

Mathematical functions map naturally to program functions and modules often are used to group such functions for reuse.

In the Ndom* language, numbers use only the digits 0-5, such that instead of "tens" and "hundreds", the second and third digits represents multiples of 6 and 36 respectively. Write a Python module with the following functions for simple Ndom arithmetic, assuming that all values have at most 3 digits.
(Reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senary)

ndom_to_decimal (a), that converts a Ndom number to decimal
decimal_to_ndom (a), that converts a decimal number to Ndom
ndom_add (a, b), that adds 2 Ndom numbers
ndom_multiply (a, b), that multiples 2 Ndom numbers
Sample I/O:

Save your module as ndom.py. The main program has been supplied as question2.py - use this to test your program and do not change this file.

Question 3

Write a module to translate sentences between English and a variant of Pig Latin (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin).

To convert from English to Pig Latin, each word must be transformed as follows:

if the word begins with a vowel, "way" should be appended (example: apple becomes appleway)
if the word begins with a sequence of consonants, this sequence should be moved to the end, prefixed with "a" and followed by "ay" (example: please becomes easeaplay)
Assume that the English text does not contain the letter "w".

Write a Python module with the following functions:

toPigLatin (s), to return the Pig Latin string for a given English string
toEnglish (s), to return the English string for a given Pig Latin string
Sample I/O:

(E)nglish or (P)ig Latin?
E
Enter an English sentence:
the quick black fox jumps over the lazy apple
Pig-Latin:
eathay uickaqay ackablay oxafay umpsajay overway eathay azyalay appleway
Sample I/O:

(E)nglish or (P)ig Latin?
P
Enter a Pig Latin sentence:
eathay uickaqay ackablay oxafay umpsajay overway eathay azyalay appleway
English:
the quick black fox jumps over the lazy apple
Save your module as piglatin.py. The main program has been supplied as question3.py - use this to test your program and do not change this file.
