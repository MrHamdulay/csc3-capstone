Scraper module to scrape JMOSS for data analysis

Description
===========

NOTE: This module serves no functional purpose to the overall system, but was used initially and
intended for further use. It remains as a piece of 'scaffholding' that was used at one point in
the development of our project, and is not intended to be marked.

This module was used to scrape JMOSS's web pages and extract its results into a usable json format.
The data was used as stand-in data while building the UI because the construction of the UI was done concurrently
with the plagiarism detection algorithm and at that point we didn't have data to work with.

This was also intended to analyze JMOSS's results to generate histograms of the number of students per
percentage of duplicated lines to total line numbers. We were to use this to test the accuracy of our
own algorithm, but ran out of time.

It makes use of Generators and Promises, a relatively new node feature being implemented in future javascript
versions. As a result node 'harmony' needs to be run, providing the features.

Usage
=====

1. download a harmony enabled version of node from: http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.11.13/
2. Extract the source to a folder
3. run node from the terminal like so:

~/Src/node-v0.11.13-darwin-x64/bin/node --harmony index.js
